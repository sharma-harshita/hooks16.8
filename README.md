In React we have two types of components : class and funtional 

We are moving from class components to functional components in React because : 
  * Class components have a proper structure like constructor and this keyword which is tricky to use , in case of fucntional component we dont have to follow any such structure.
  * Since JS is a functional programming language , so classes are not that much preferred
  * Functional component is faster in execution compared to class
